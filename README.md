  # Professional README Generator     
         
  ## Description    
  A good, solid README file is a necessity for a professional GitHub Repo. This project is a terminal application that swiftly generates a well-made README file. This is useful to me and any other developers because writing a good looking README file can take some time that could be better spent coding the project itself. This application makes this process quicker by having a pre-determined template set up and taking input from the user to generate the key portions of a README file.     
      
  ## Installation    
  This application is run using Node.js. The user will need to install this in order to use the application. To get the application running, clone the GitHub repo to a location on a computer, navigate to the location in your preferred command terminal, and run npm i. This will install the inquirer npm library which is necessary for the application to take in your input. After the package is installed, in the root folder of the repo, run node index.js to start the application.    
      
  ## Usage    
  Once the application is running, in the command terminal, the user will be asked a series of questions regarding the project for which they would like to generate a README file. Once the questions are answered, the README file will be automatically created in the current working directory.   
      
  ## Credits   
  To create this project, I mainly referred to my recorded lectures on the topic of Node.js. They were taught by Junghoon "Jung" Yoon.
